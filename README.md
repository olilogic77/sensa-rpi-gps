# SensaWeb GPS data collector
## sensa-rpi-gps
This application is intended to run as a daemon on a RaspberryPi with a LoraWan/GPS hat, saving GPS information to a file at given time intervals.

It is expected that another daemon will deal with transferring the files to data collection points (whether that is a GCP Pub/Sub MTTQ endpoint, a file server, an FTP server, a REST or API interface or similar...)
